# SideWall
Social Job Board and Ride Sharing Website Helping More People Get Jobs Regardless of Whether You Own a Car

SideWall can connect people already in a community who need jobs and can't afford cars/transit with other members of that community who can rideshare on their way to jobs at similar locations. More people get jobs because more people can commute to the areas that are experiencing economic growth regardless of where they originally live in that city. People find jobs on our job board and can make "connections" with registered profiles/routes on a map that match their job criteria. They then can message other users profiles and work out details.
